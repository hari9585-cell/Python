# Python Basics

# Steps :

1. Download / open the Jupyter through anaconda navigator
2. Opened a new notebook and connect to Kernal.
3. Worked on below questions:
4. Exercise 1 Write Python code that prints your name, student number and email address. An example runs of the program: Bob ST1001 bob@gmail.com.
5. Exercise 2 Write Python code that prints your name, student number and email address using escape sequences. An example runs of the program: Bob ST1001 bob@gmail.com.
6. Exercise 3 Write Python code that add, subtract, multiply and divide the two numbers. You can use the two numbers 14 and 7. An example run of the program: 14 + 7 = 21 14 * 7 = 98 14 – 7 = 7 14 / 7 = 2 
7. Exercise 4 Write Python code that displays the numbers from 1 to 5 as steps. An example runs of the program: 1 2 3 4 5 
8. Exercise 5 Write Python code that outputs the following sentence (including the quotation marks and line break) to the screen: An example runs of the program: "SDK" stands for "Software Development Kit", whereas "IDE" stands for "Integrated Development Environment". 
9. Exercise 6 Practice and check the output print("python is an \"awesome\" language.") print("python\n\t2023") print('I\'m from Entri.\b') print("\65") print("\x65") print("Entri", "2023", sep="\n") print("Entri", "2023", sep="\b") print("Entri", "2023", sep="*", end="\b\b\b\b") 
10. Exercise 7 Define the variables below. Print the types of each variable. What is the sum of your variables? (Hint: use a type conversion function.) What datatype is the sum? num=23 textnum="57" decimal=98.3 Exercise 8 calculate the number of minutes in a year using variables for each unit of time. print a statement that describes what your code does also. Create three variables to store no of days in a year, minute in a hour, hours in a day, then calculate the total minutes in a year and print the values (hint) total number of minutes in an year =No.of days in an year * Hours in a day * Minutes in an hour.
11. Exercise 9 Write Python code that asks the user to enter his/her name and then output/prints his/her name with a greeting. An example runs of the program: Please enter you name: Tony Hi Tony, welcome to Python programming :) 
12. Exercise 10 Name your file: PoundsToDollars.py Write a program that asks the user to enter an amount in pounds (£) and the program calculates and converts an amount in dollar ($) An example runs of the program: Please enter amount in pounds: XXX £ XXX are $ XXX

# Conditional and Looping Statements

# Steps :

1. Opened Jupyter noteook.
2. Connecte to Kernel.
3. Worked on Excercise below.
4. Named the workbook as Assignment 3.
5. Checked on Excercise and started the work as below:
6. Exercise 1 Name your file: MonthNames.py Write a program that reads an integer value between 1 and 12 from the user and prints output the corresponding month of the year. An example run of the program (numbers in bold are typed in by the user) Enter the month: 3 Month 3 is March 
7. Exercise 2 A certain cinema currently sells tickets for a full price of 6 pounds, but always sells tickets for half price to people who are less than 16 years old, and for a third of the price for people who are 60 years old or more. An example run of the program (numbers in bold are typed in by the user) Enter your age: 63 Your ticket costs £2.00 
8. Exercise 3 Name your file: BodyMassIndex.py Write a program to calculate your BMI and give weight status. Body Mass Index (BMI) is an internationally used measurement to check if you are a healthy weight for your height.The metric BMI formula accepts weight in kilograms and height in meters: BMI= weight(kg)/height2(m2) BMI Weight Status Categories table BMI range - kg/m2 Category Below 18.5 Underweight 18.5 -24.9 Normal 25 - 29.9 Overweight 30 & Above Obese An example run of the program (numbers in bold are typed in by the user) Enter your weight in (kg): 75 Enter your height in (m): 1.70 Your BMI is: 25.95 You are in the “overweight” range. 
9. Exercise 4 Write a Python program to receive 3 numbers from the user and print the greatest among them. 
10. Exercise 5 Find the factorial of a given number using loops(note the number is received from the user) 
11. Exercise 6 Reverse a number using while loop 
12. Exercise 7 Finding the multiples of a number using loop 
13. Exercise 8 Write a program to print the inputted value as it is and break the loop if the value is 'done'. Example run of the program :hello there hello there :finished finished :done Done 
14. Exercise 9 Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiple of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz" 
15. Exercise 10 Write a program to print the following pattern: 5 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 3 2 1 2 1 1
