# Python Basics

# Steps :

1. Download / open the Jupyter through anaconda navigator
2. Opened a new notebook and connect to Kernal.
3. Worked on below questions:
4. Exercise 1 Write Python code that prints your name, student number and email address. An example runs of the program: Bob ST1001 bob@gmail.com.
5. Exercise 2 Write Python code that prints your name, student number and email address using escape sequences. An example runs of the program: Bob ST1001 bob@gmail.com.
6. Exercise 3 Write Python code that add, subtract, multiply and divide the two numbers. You can use the two numbers 14 and 7. An example run of the program: 14 + 7 = 21 14 * 7 = 98 14 – 7 = 7 14 / 7 = 2 
7. Exercise 4 Write Python code that displays the numbers from 1 to 5 as steps. An example runs of the program: 1 2 3 4 5 
8. Exercise 5 Write Python code that outputs the following sentence (including the quotation marks and line break) to the screen: An example runs of the program: "SDK" stands for "Software Development Kit", whereas "IDE" stands for "Integrated Development Environment". 
9. Exercise 6 Practice and check the output print("python is an \"awesome\" language.") print("python\n\t2023") print('I\'m from Entri.\b') print("\65") print("\x65") print("Entri", "2023", sep="\n") print("Entri", "2023", sep="\b") print("Entri", "2023", sep="*", end="\b\b\b\b") 
10. Exercise 7 Define the variables below. Print the types of each variable. What is the sum of your variables? (Hint: use a type conversion function.) What datatype is the sum? num=23 textnum="57" decimal=98.3 Exercise 8 calculate the number of minutes in a year using variables for each unit of time. print a statement that describes what your code does also. Create three variables to store no of days in a year, minute in a hour, hours in a day, then calculate the total minutes in a year and print the values (hint) total number of minutes in an year =No.of days in an year * Hours in a day * Minutes in an hour.
11. Exercise 9 Write Python code that asks the user to enter his/her name and then output/prints his/her name with a greeting. An example runs of the program: Please enter you name: Tony Hi Tony, welcome to Python programming :) 
12. Exercise 10 Name your file: PoundsToDollars.py Write a program that asks the user to enter an amount in pounds (£) and the program calculates and converts an amount in dollar ($) An example runs of the program: Please enter amount in pounds: XXX £ XXX are $ XXX
